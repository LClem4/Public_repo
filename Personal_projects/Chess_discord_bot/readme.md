# Description
    Note: United States Chess Federation (USCF)

    This program runs a chess bot that can request data pertaining to USCF ratings. Since this is my own personal bot,
    you will not be able to run it, but you can run the chess_functions.py which can gather USCF chess ratings without the
    discord interface. chess_functions.py will update the ratings of those listed in the ratings.csv.

# Run
    Example: python3 chess_functions.py
