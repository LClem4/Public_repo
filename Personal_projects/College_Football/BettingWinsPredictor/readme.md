# Description
    This program gets the college football bowl games from 2013 to 2022 and checks how often they predict the winner for each year. Note that authorization is required from 
    where cfbd gets the data. This key can be provided on line 14 and the key prefix on line 15. This program needs to be improved as it could be parsed in a more efficient manner.

# Run
    Example: python3 BettingWinsPredictor.py
