# Description
    The purpose of this programming project was to help us better understand how to use the 7-segment display
    on the BasysMX3 microcontroller. The attached code is for questions 1-5 of 'Lab Assignment 3.pdf'. The switches
    are used to run the code associated with each question.

# compile and run
    This project was built using the mplab 5.35 environment for the PIC32MX370F512L Microcontroller and was
    written using 'xc.h.' Using these tools you should be able to run the program.
