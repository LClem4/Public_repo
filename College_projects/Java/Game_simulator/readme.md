# Description
	This program is a simulation of a game of aliens vs humans. In the game, aliens and humans pick up weapons, move, and inflict damage
	on the opposing team. When one side eliminates an opponent their score increases by 1, the opponent then respawns back into the game. 
	After a set number of rounds, the team that has the highest score wins. There are various components that go into this game with the focus
	being on implementing design patterns including but not limited to the strategy, observer, command, and singleton patterns.

# Run
	This game was made using eclipse so it is recommended to use that or a similar environment. Run the simulator class to start the game.
