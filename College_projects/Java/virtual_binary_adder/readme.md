# Description
    This project was a simple project to make a virtual binary ripple adder using logic gates. The size of the binary adder can be dynamically adjusted. For this project, 
    the sizes we used were 8 bit and 16 bit adders but you can change the size of the adder in the source code where RippleAdder objects are initialized.

# Run
    There isn't a main class but running the TestRippleAdder class would probably be the best.
