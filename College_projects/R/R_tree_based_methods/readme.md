# Description
    The purpose of this project was to use R to analyze a data set on mortages and one on professors. We used tree based methods
    including decision trees, bagged trees, random forests, and boosted trees to predict classifications of mortageas and 
    salaries of professors. The results are in tree_based_methods.pdf.

# Run
    run R script: Use posit cloud or R studio cloud to knit tree_based_methods.qmd
