# Description
    The purpose of this project was to use R to recreate a graph from the website fivethirtyeight. We chose a graph on Trumps approval rating while he was president.
    The graph also had a slider that displayed the value your mouse was on. This feature was difficult to duplicate.

# Run
    run R script: Use posit cloud or R studio cloud to run R_graph.Rmd which will allow you to see the graph.
