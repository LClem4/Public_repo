# Description
    The purpose of this project was to analyze a data set of our choice using R. We made graphs and derived simple statistics using R. The data set
    we used was a large data set containing various metrics on colleges (unfortunately the data set is too large for GitHub). The results are in Midterm.pdf.

# Run
    Data set is unavailable and so the script cannot be run
