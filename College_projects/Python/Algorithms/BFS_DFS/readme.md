# Description
        The purpose of this program was to design a program that would would implement breadth first search and depth first
        search by traversing an unweighted graph.

# Run
        1. Run the program using 'python3 BFS_DFS.py' in the local directory
        2. You will be prompted to type in a csv file from the local directory (make sure to inclcude .csv)
        3. You will be asked if you want to sort the edges. Typing 'T' will sort the edges in increasing order. Anything else will default to the order they were given in the csv.
        4. enter the start node and then the end node

        Note: version Python 3.10.12
        Note: that entering an invalid node or file will cause the program to display an error and immediately exit
