# Description
        The purpose of this program was to design a program that would would implement the A* and IDA* algorithms by
        traversing through a weighted graph.

# Run
        1. Run A*: 'python3 main.py A' or IDA*: 'python3 main.py IDA' in the local directory
        2. You will be prompted to type in the "EdgeWeights.csv"
        3. You will be prompted to type in the "hCosts.csv"
        4. enter the start node and then the end node

        Note: version Python 3.10.12
        Note: that entering an invalid algorithm, node, or file will cause the program to display an error and immediately exit
