# Description
    This is a repository containing a large portion of my college and personal projects that I have programmed over the years. 

    All projects are divided into two categories: school based projects and personal projects. The school based projects are further divided 
    into the language they were programmed in. This helps keep things more organized. Most projects are functional but may require special means
    of getting them to run. When possible, sample output is provided.

# Message
    Thank you for looking at my GitHub repository! Feel free to examine, clone, and run my projects. Just note that I am still working on this repo and not everything is included and formatted the way I want, so some adjustments will be made. Dependencies for most projects are not fully listed but will be included in future updates. Thanks!
